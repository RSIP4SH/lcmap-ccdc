Nouns

bounds
timeseries - date/date
models
ancillaries
products - date
results - general functions on result structures

Timeseries
----------
Can be loaded from Cassandra or produced from Chipmunk.  Spectral bands.
- read(bounds, timerange)
- write()
- execute(bounds, timerange, ubids=defaulted)

DEM
---
- read(bounds, timerange)
- write()
- execute(bounds, timerange, ubids=default)

Aspect
------
- read(bounds, timerange)
- write()
- execute(bounds, timerange, ubids=default)

Trends
------
- read(bounds, timerange)
- write()
- execute(bounds, timerange, ubids=default)

MPW
---
- read(bounds, timerange)
- write()
- execute(bounds, timerange, ubids=default)

Posidex
-------
- read(bounds, timerange)
- write()
- execute(bounds, timerange, ubids=default)


Ancillaries (is it better to talk directly about DEM, Aspect, etc?)
-----------
Can be loaded from Cassandra or produced from Chipmunk.  Single date values.
- read(bounds, timerange)
- write()
- execute(bounds, timerange, ubids=defaulted)

Pyccd
-----
Can be loaded from Cassandra or produced from timeseries.
- read(bounds)
- write() n
- execute(timeseries)

Training
--------
Can be loaded from Cassandra or produced from pyccd and ancillary.
- read(bounds)
- write()
- execute(bounds)

Classification
--------------
Can be loaded from Cassandra or produced from trained classifiers.
- read(bounds)
- write()
- execute(bounds)

Results
-------
Given a set of bounds and an rdd, what data is missing from the rdd?
Given an rdd, what items are in error?
Given an rdd, how many items are there?
Provide function to create a success() result.
Provide function to create an error() result.

JobConf
-------
- read(hashcode)
- write(hashcode, {})
- execute({})

CLI
---
- expose cwr for each Noun via command prompt.
